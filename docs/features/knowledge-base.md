# Knowledge Base

This page you're reading now? It's part of your knowledge base—the repository of context
that makes Carmenta useful to you.

## How It Works

Your knowledge base is organized by namespaces:

**profile.\*** — Core information about you. Always present in every conversation. Who
you are, how you work, what you're focused on.

**knowledge.\*** — Your accumulated context. Searched and retrieved when relevant.
Projects, decisions, insights, research.

**docs.\*** — System documentation like this page. Read-only, searchable. Helps us
answer questions about ourselves.

Each namespace behaves differently. Profile is always there. Knowledge is pulled in when
it matters. Docs are reference material.

## Profile Documents

Your profile tells us who you are and how to work with you:

**Identity** — Your name, role, background. What makes you tick.

**Preferences** — Communication style, work patterns. What you like and don't.

**Goals** — Current priorities and longer-term vision. What you're working toward.

**People** — Key relationships. Who matters to your work and why.

**Character** — How we should interact with you. Voice, personality, boundaries.

When you start a conversation, we read your entire profile. This means we always know
how to address you, what you care about, who matters to you, and what you're focused on.

No more explaining who you are.

## Knowledge Documents

The knowledge namespace stores context that should be searchable but not always present:

**Projects** — What you're working on. Purpose, status, key decisions.

**Research** — Findings, analysis, synthesized learnings.

**Decisions** — Choices you've made and why. Referenced when similar questions arise.

**Insights** — Patterns, realizations, things worth remembering.

**Conversations** — Summaries extracted from past discussions. Decisions, commitments,
and context preserved.

When you ask a question, we search knowledge documents for relevant context. Matching
documents join the conversation.

## The Knowledge Librarian

The Knowledge Librarian manages your knowledge base. She's an AI agent who:

**Extracts what matters** — After meaningful exchanges, she evaluates what's worth
preserving. Is this durable information? Is it unique to you? Will it be useful later?

**Organizes intelligently** — Decides where new information belongs. Updates existing
documents or creates new ones. Places context where you'll find it.

**Evolves structure** — Your knowledge base grows organically. A single fact becomes a
document section. Rich topics expand into folders. The structure reflects how you
actually work.

You can ask about what the Librarian has learned: "What did you save from our last
conversation?" She'll tell you what was extracted and where it lives.

## Building Your Knowledge Base

Your knowledge base grows through:

**Direct input** — You create documents, update your profile, add what matters.

**Conversation extraction** — The Librarian extracts commitments, decisions, and
insights automatically after meaningful exchanges.

**Integration sync** — Connected services contribute context. Meeting transcripts from
Fireflies or Limitless become searchable. Calendar events, task updates, documents from
Notion or Dropbox—all flow into your knowledge base.

The knowledge base starts sparse. That's fine. Fill it as things come up. Over time,
Carmenta knows you better and conversations flow more naturally.

## Editing and Control

Profile and knowledge documents are yours to edit. Click to view, modify what needs
changing, save when done.

System docs (like this one) are read-only—maintained by us and updated with each
deployment.

Everything we know about you is visible here. No hidden profiles. No secret inferences
built from patterns you can't see. What you see is what we know. Complete transparency.

## Version History

Every document in your knowledge base maintains version history. You can see how your
knowledge has evolved, when documents were last updated, and what changed.

This also means you can recover from mistakes. If something was edited incorrectly or
the Librarian made an extraction you disagree with, you can roll back.

## Why This Matters

The knowledge base is the foundation of everything else.

Other tools: Every conversation starts fresh. You explain who you are. What you're
working on. What you decided last week. The same context, rebuilt from scratch, over and
over.

Carmenta: We already know. Context persists. The relationship compounds over time.

This is what enables the 100x framework. You can't have a 10x AI team without shared
memory. You can't have a 100x vision execution partner without accumulated context.

The knowledge base is where partnership begins.
