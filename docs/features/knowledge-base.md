# Knowledge Base

This page you're reading now? It's part of your knowledge base—the repository of context
that makes Carmenta useful to you.

## How It Works

Your knowledge base is organized by namespaces:

**profile.\*** — Core information about you. Always present in every conversation. Who
you are, how you work, what you're focused on.

**knowledge.\*** — Your accumulated context. Searched and retrieved when relevant.
Projects, decisions, insights, research.

**docs.\*** — System documentation like this page. Read-only, searchable. Helps Carmenta
answer questions about itself.

Each namespace behaves differently. Profile is always there. Knowledge is pulled in when
it matters. Docs are reference material.

## Profile Documents

Your profile tells Carmenta who you are and how to work with you:

**Identity** — Your name, role, background. What makes you tick.

**Preferences** — Communication style, work patterns. What you like and don't.

**Goals** — Current priorities and longer-term vision. What you're working toward.

**People** — Key relationships. Who matters to your work and why.

**Character** — How Carmenta should interact with you. Voice, personality, boundaries.

When you start a conversation, Carmenta reads your entire profile. This means we always
know how to address you, what you care about, who matters to you, and what you're
focused on.

No more explaining who you are.

## Knowledge Documents

The knowledge namespace stores context that should be searchable but not always present:

**Projects** — What you're working on. Purpose, status, key decisions.

**Research** — Findings, analysis, synthesized learnings.

**Decisions** — Choices you've made and why. Referenced when similar questions arise.

**Insights** — Patterns, realizations, things worth remembering.

When you ask a question, Carmenta searches knowledge documents for relevant context.
Matching documents join the conversation.

## Building Your Knowledge Base

Your knowledge base grows over time through:

**Direct input** — You create documents, update your profile, add what matters.

**Conversation extraction** — We notice commitments, decisions, and insights worth
saving. We'll offer to capture them.

**Integration sync** — Connected services contribute context. Meeting transcripts,
project updates, documents—all become searchable.

The knowledge base starts sparse. That's fine. Fill it as things come up. Over time,
Carmenta knows you better and conversations flow more naturally.

## Editing and Control

Profile and knowledge documents are yours to edit. Click to view, modify what needs
changing, save when done.

System docs (like this one) are read-only—maintained by us and updated with each
deployment.

Everything Carmenta knows about you is visible here. No hidden profiles. No secret
inferences. What you see is what we know.

## Why This Matters

The knowledge base is the foundation of everything else.

Other tools: Every conversation starts fresh. You explain who you are, what you're
working on, what you need.

Carmenta: Context persists. We know you. The relationship compounds over time.

This is what enables the 100x framework. You can't have a 10x AI team without shared
memory. You can't have a 100x vision execution partner without accumulated context.

The knowledge base is where partnership begins.
