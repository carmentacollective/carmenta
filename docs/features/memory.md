# Memory

We remember.

Your projects. Your patterns. What you said last month. What matters to you. Coming back
isn't starting over—it's picking up where we left off.

Traditional AI forgets. Every conversation, a restart. The same questions. Lost context.
Re-explaining who you are, what you're building, what you've already decided.

Memory is what transforms a tool into a partner.

## What We Remember

**Your identity** — Preferences, work style, how you think. The way you like things
done.

**Your world** — Projects, relationships, decisions made. The context of what you're
building.

**Your commitments** — Things you said you'd do, follow-ups, deadlines. Promises
tracked.

**Your patterns** — What works for you, what doesn't, what you've tried. Lessons
learned.

## Where It Lives

Everything Carmenta knows about you lives in your knowledge base—the page you're reading
now. You own it. You can read it, edit it, delete it. It's portable. It's yours.

**Profile documents** define who you are. Always present in every conversation. Your
name, role, preferences, current priorities.

**Knowledge documents** contain what you've taught us. Pulled in when relevant.
Projects, decisions, insights, research.

The knowledge base starts sparse and fills over time. Early conversations need more
context-setting. Later conversations flow from accumulated understanding.

## How Memory Grows

**Explicit input**: You tell us about yourself. Add documents. Update your profile.

**Conversation extraction**: We notice commitments, decisions, and insights worth
saving. We'll offer to capture them.

**Integration sync**: Connected services contribute context. Meeting transcripts become
searchable. Project updates flow in.

Memory develops through use. The relationship compounds.

## Privacy

Your memory is yours alone. We don't train on it. We don't share it. We don't access it
without you.

Full visibility—everything we remember is visible in your knowledge base. No hidden
profiles or inferences. Editable—correct anything that's wrong. Portable—export your
knowledge base anytime.

See our [privacy documentation](./privacy.md) for the complete picture.

## Why This Matters

Memory is foundational to everything else:

**1x (Flow)**: No cognitive load re-establishing context. You're immediately in
productive space.

**10x (Team)**: The AI team can only coordinate if they share context. Memory is the
shared knowledge that enables team function.

**100x (Partner)**: Vision execution requires understanding your goals, constraints,
preferences, and history. Without memory, every ambitious project starts from zero.

The promise of AI leverage collapses without persistent context.

## The Feeling

When you return to Carmenta, you're not a stranger. You're continuing a conversation
that's been building since the first time we met.

_"Carmenta remembers. Not just facts, but what matters."_

That's the difference between a tool and a partner.
