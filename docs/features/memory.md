# Memory

We remember.

Your projects. Your patterns. What you said last month. What matters to you. Coming back
isn't starting over—it's picking up where we left off.

Traditional AI forgets. Every session starts over. You explain who you are again.
Re-state your preferences. Rebuild context from zero. The exhaustion of constantly
re-establishing ground truth.

Memory is what transforms a tool into a partner.

## What We Remember

**Your identity** — Preferences, work style, how you think. The way you like things
done.

**Your world** — Projects, relationships, decisions made. The context of what you're
building.

**Your commitments** — Things you said you'd do, follow-ups, deadlines. Promises
tracked.

**Your patterns** — What works for you, what doesn't, what you've tried. Lessons
learned.

## How Memory Works

Memory operates in layers, each serving a different purpose:

**Always present** — Your profile documents join every conversation automatically. We
know your name, your preferences, how to work with you before you say a word.

**Retrieved when relevant** — Your knowledge documents are searched when you ask about
something. Projects, decisions, research—pulled in when they matter to the conversation.

**Conversation history** — Recent exchanges stay in working memory. Older messages get
summarized at natural topic boundaries, preserving decisions and insights while reducing
noise.

This layered approach means we maintain context without degrading performance. Long
conversations work just as well as short ones because we're intelligent about what stays
in focus versus what gets archived for retrieval.

## The Knowledge Librarian

Behind the scenes, the Knowledge Librarian watches our conversations and extracts what's
worth preserving. When you mention a decision, introduce a person, or share an insight,
she evaluates: Is this durable? Is it unique? Will it be useful later?

What passes the test gets organized into your knowledge base—placed in the right
location, connected to related context, structured for future retrieval.

This happens automatically. You don't need to tell us what to remember. The Librarian
handles extraction, organization, and the gradual evolution of your knowledge structure
as it grows.

Think of her as the first member of your AI team. She's the reason context accumulates
without effort.

## Where It Lives

Everything we know about you lives in your knowledge base. You own it. You can read it,
edit it, delete it. It's portable. It's yours.

**Profile documents** (`profile.*`) define who you are. Always present in every
conversation. Your name, role, preferences, current priorities.

**Knowledge documents** (`knowledge.*`) contain what you've taught us. Searched and
retrieved when relevant. Projects, decisions, insights, research.

The knowledge base starts sparse and fills over time. Early conversations need more
context-setting. Later conversations flow from accumulated understanding.

## How Memory Grows

**Explicit input**: You tell us about yourself. Add documents. Update your profile.

**Conversation extraction**: The Knowledge Librarian notices commitments, decisions, and
insights worth saving. Extraction happens automatically after meaningful exchanges.

**Integration sync**: Connected services contribute context. Meeting transcripts from
Fireflies or Limitless become searchable. Calendar events provide temporal context.

Memory develops through use. The relationship compounds.

## Privacy

Your memory is yours alone. We don't train on it. We don't share it. We don't access it
without you.

Full visibility—everything we remember is visible in your knowledge base. No hidden
profiles or inferences. Editable—correct anything that's wrong. Portable—export your
knowledge base anytime.

See our [privacy documentation](../privacy.md) for the complete picture.

## Why This Matters

Memory is foundational to our [100x Framework](../philosophy/100x-framework.md):

**1x (Flow)**: No cognitive load re-establishing context. You're immediately in
productive space.

**10x (Team)**: The AI team can only coordinate if they share context. Memory is the
shared knowledge that enables team function.

**100x (Partner)**: Vision execution requires understanding your goals, constraints,
preferences, and history. Without memory, every ambitious project starts from zero.

The promise of AI leverage collapses without persistent context.

This is also why we say "we remember" instead of "Carmenta stores data." Memory is how
you show you care. See [Heart-Centered AI](../philosophy/heart-centered.md) for why this
matters.

## The Feeling

When you return to Carmenta after days or weeks, there's no awkward restart. No "remind
me where we left off." We know. Your projects, your people, your patterns—still here,
still current.

You're not a stranger. You're home.

That's the difference between a tool and a partner.
