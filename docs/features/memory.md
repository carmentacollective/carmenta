# Memory

Memory is what makes Carmenta different from other AI tools. It's the foundation for
relationship, context, and the entire 100x framework.

## The Problem Memory Solves

<without-memory>
Traditional AI conversations start fresh every time:

"Hi, I'm working on a project called X for client Y. The tech stack is Z. Last week we
decided to use approach A because of reasons B and C. I need help with..."

Every. Single. Time.

This cognitive load prevents flow. You spend energy re-establishing context instead of
making progress. </without-memory>

<with-memory>
Carmenta remembers:

"Let's continue where we left off with the authentication system. Last time you decided
to use JWT over sessions because of the microservices architecture. Want to tackle the
token refresh logic now?"

Context persists. The relationship compounds. </with-memory>

## How Memory Works

<memory-architecture>
Memory has multiple layers:

Profile: Who you are. Always present. Injected into every conversation automatically.

Knowledge Base: What you know. Searchable. Retrieved when relevant.

Conversation History: What we've discussed. Accessible for reference and continuity.

Extracted Insights: What Carmenta has learned. Commitments made. Decisions recorded.
Patterns recognized. </memory-architecture>

## Memory in Practice

<what-carmenta-remembers>
Identity: Your name, role, background, preferences, communication style.

Relationships: Who matters to you. Context about each person. How they connect to your
work.

Projects: What you're working on. Status, decisions, key stakeholders.

Decisions: Choices you've made and why. Referenced when similar situations arise.

Commitments: Promises made in conversation. Tracked and followed up.

Preferences: How you like things done. Patterns in your requests. What works for you.

## Memory and the 100x Framework

<memory-enables-100x>
Memory is foundational to each level:

1x (Flow): No cognitive load re-establishing context. You're immediately in productive
space.

10x (Team): The AI team can only coordinate if they share context. Memory is the shared
knowledge base that enables team function.

100x (Partner): Vision execution requires understanding your goals, constraints,
preferences, and history. Without memory, every ambitious project starts from zero.

The promise of AI leverage collapses without persistent context. </memory-enables-100x>

## How Memory Develops

<memory-evolution>
Memory grows through use:

Explicit Input: You tell Carmenta about yourself, add documents to the knowledge base,
update your profile.

Conversation Extraction: Carmenta notices commitments, decisions, and insights in
conversation and offers to save them.

Integration Sync: Connected services contribute context. Meeting transcripts become
searchable. Project updates flow in.

The knowledge base starts sparse and fills over time. Early conversations require more
context-setting. Later conversations flow from accumulated understanding.
</memory-evolution>

## Privacy and Control

<memory-principles>
You own your memory:

Full Visibility: Everything Carmenta remembers is visible in the knowledge base. No
hidden profiles or inferences.

Editable: Correct anything that's wrong. Delete what shouldn't be there.

Portable: Export your knowledge base. Your context is yours.

Scoped: Different documents have different scope. Profile is always present. Knowledge
is searched when relevant. You control what goes where. </memory-principles>

## The Relationship Metaphor

<memory-as-relationship>
Memory is what transforms Carmenta from tool to partner.

Tools are stateless. You pick them up, use them, put them down. Each use is independent.

Partners remember. They know your context, your preferences, your history. They build on
previous interactions.

Carmenta is designed as partner. Memory is what makes partnership possible.

The feeling: "This was built by someone who works the way I work. Coming home."
