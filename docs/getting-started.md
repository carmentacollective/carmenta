# Getting Started

Welcome. Let's get you set up.

## First Steps

When you first arrive, Carmenta creates a knowledge base for you with some starter
documents. This is where your context lives—who you are, what you're working on, how you
like to communicate.

**Start with your profile.** Head to the knowledge base and fill in the basics:

- Who you are and what you do
- Your current projects and priorities
- How you prefer to communicate

The more Carmenta knows, the less you have to explain. Every conversation builds on what
came before.

## Connecting Your Services

Carmenta becomes more useful when it can see your world. Connect the services you use:

- **Notion** — Access your docs and databases
- **Slack** — Search messages and stay connected
- **Gmail** — Read and search your email
- **Google Calendar** — See your schedule
- **ClickUp** — Manage tasks and projects
- **Dropbox** — Access your files
- **Fireflies / Limitless** — Meeting transcripts and recordings

Each integration uses OAuth—secure, scoped to what you authorize, encrypted at rest. One
subscription covers everything.

## Your First Conversation

Just talk. Voice or text, whatever feels natural.

You might start with:

- "What's on my calendar tomorrow?"
- "Find my Notion doc about [project name]"
- "Help me think through this problem I'm facing..."
- "Create a task for the thing we just discussed"

Carmenta figures out what you need. No special commands. No learning curve.

## Building Your Knowledge Base

Your knowledge base grows over time. Add documents as things come up:

- Projects you're working on
- Key decisions you've made (and why)
- People who matter to your work
- Patterns and preferences you want remembered

You can add things directly, or Carmenta will notice things worth saving and offer to
capture them for you.

## What to Expect

**First day**: Getting oriented. Setting up profile and connections. First
conversations.

**First week**: The context starts compounding. Carmenta begins to know your patterns,
your projects, your people.

**First month**: You stop explaining yourself. Conversations pick up where they left
off. The relief of being remembered.

**Ongoing**: The relationship deepens. Your AI team forms around your actual work. The
gap between imagination and creation gets smaller.

## The Feeling

When this is working well, it feels like coming home.

Not a new tool to learn. Not another interface to manage. A partner who knows you,
remembers you, and works alongside you.

That's what we're building together.
