# Privacy

Your data is yours. This is what that means.

## What We Store

**Your knowledge base**: Profile information, documents you create, insights extracted
from conversations. This is your context—what makes Carmenta useful to you.

**Conversation history**: What we've discussed. Accessible for continuity and reference.

**Integration credentials**: OAuth tokens for connected services. Encrypted at rest,
decrypted only when actively used for API calls.

**Usage data**: Basic analytics to improve the product. Never the content of your
conversations.

## What We Don't Do

**We don't train on your data.** Your conversations, your knowledge base, your
documents—none of it feeds into model training. Your context is yours.

**We don't share your data.** No selling to third parties. No advertising partnerships.
No data brokers.

**We don't access without purpose.** Your information is accessed only to serve your
requests. No employees browsing your knowledge base.

## Your Control

**Full visibility**: Everything Carmenta knows about you is visible in your knowledge
base. No hidden profiles or secret inferences. What you see is what we know.

**Editable**: Anything in your knowledge base can be changed or deleted. Correct what's
wrong. Remove what shouldn't be there.

**Portable**: Export your knowledge base anytime. Your context belongs to you, not us.

**Deletable**: Request full deletion and we'll remove everything associated with your
account.

## Integration Security

When you connect services like Notion, Slack, or Gmail:

- You authorize specific permissions through OAuth
- Credentials are encrypted at rest
- We request minimum necessary access
- You can disconnect at any time
- Disconnecting revokes our access immediately

## Our Commitment

Privacy isn't a feature we bolt on. It's foundational to who we are.

Heart-centered AI means caring for you—which means protecting what's yours. Trust is
earned through action, not policy pages. We take this seriously.

## Questions

If something here isn't clear, or you have concerns about your data, reach out. We'd
rather talk it through than leave you uncertain.
