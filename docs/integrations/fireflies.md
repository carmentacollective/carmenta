# Fireflies Integration

Connect Fireflies to Carmenta. Meeting transcripts and notes become searchable context.

## What It Is

Fireflies joins your video meetings and creates transcripts, summaries, and notes.
Connect it to Carmenta and all that content becomes part of your memory.

## What You Can Do

**Search meetings** — "Find the meeting where we discussed the roadmap"

**Read transcripts** — "What did the client say in yesterday's call?"

**Get summaries** — "Summarize my meetings from last week"

**Find decisions** — "What action items came out of the kickoff?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Fireflies
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your transcripts

Meeting content syncs automatically.

## How We Use It

When you ask about meetings, we search your Fireflies transcripts for relevant content.
Discussions, decisions, and action items become findable long after the meeting ends.

This solves the "what did we decide?" problem. Meeting context persists. Follow-ups are
trackable. The thread of conversation continues.

## Example Conversations

_"What was the outcome of the investor call?"_

_"Search my meeting transcripts for mentions of the API"_

_"What commitments did I make in yesterday's sync?"_

_"Who was in the product planning meeting?"_

## Privacy

Transcripts are searched when relevant. We don't access meetings in real-time or monitor
ongoing calls. What's captured is what Fireflies captures. Disconnect anytime to stop
syncing new meetings.
