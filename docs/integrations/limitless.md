# Limitless Integration

Connect Limitless to Carmenta. Your wearable audio transcripts become searchable
context.

## What It Is

Limitless is a wearable that captures and transcribes your conversations throughout the
day. Connect it to Carmenta and those transcripts become part of your memory.

## What You Can Do

**Search conversations** — "What did I talk about with the client last week?"

**Find context** — "What was decided in this morning's meeting?"

**Reference discussions** — "What did Sarah say about the timeline?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Limitless
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your transcripts

Transcripts sync automatically once connected.

## How We Use It

When you ask about past conversations, we search your Limitless transcripts for relevant
context. Discussions, decisions, and commitments become findable.

This is powerful for memory. Things you said in a meeting become reference-able later.
Commitments you made are trackable. Context you'd otherwise forget is preserved.

## Example Conversations

_"What did we decide about the launch date?"_

_"Search my recordings for mentions of the budget"_

_"What feedback did I get on the presentation?"_

## Privacy

Transcripts are searched when you ask. We don't continuously monitor or process your
audio. What's captured is what Limitless captures; we just make it searchable.
Disconnect anytime to stop syncing new transcripts.
