# Google Calendar Integration

Connect Google Calendar to Carmenta. See your schedule, create events, and check
availability through natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

**View schedule** — "What meetings do I have tomorrow?"

**Create events** — "Schedule a call with Sarah for next Tuesday at 2pm"

**Check availability** — "When am I free this week?"

**Find meetings** — "When's my next 1:1 with the team lead?"

**Manage events** — "Move my dentist appointment to Thursday"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Google Calendar
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your calendar
4. Select which calendars to include

You choose which calendars we can see.

## How We Use It

When you ask about your schedule, we check your connected calendars. Availability,
upcoming meetings, and conflicts become part of the conversation.

Creating events requires confirmation. We'll show you the details before adding anything
to your calendar.

## Example Conversations

_"What's on my calendar today?"_

_"Am I free for lunch on Friday?"_

_"Schedule a project kickoff for Monday morning"_

_"Cancel my afternoon meetings"_

## Context for Conversations

Calendar awareness makes other conversations smarter. When discussing meeting prep, we
know what's coming up. When tracking commitments, we know your time constraints.

## Privacy

We access only calendars you've authorized. Event details are used for context, not
stored permanently. Credentials are encrypted. Disconnect anytime.
