# Google Calendar & Contacts Integration

Connect your Google account and we bring your calendar and contacts into the
conversation. Check your schedule, create events, look up people—all naturally.

## What You Can Do

**View schedule** — "What meetings do I have tomorrow?"

**Create events** — "Schedule a call with Sarah for next Tuesday at 2pm"

**Check availability** — "When am I free this week?"

**Find meetings** — "When's my next 1:1 with the team lead?"

**Manage events** — "Move my dentist appointment to Thursday"

**Look up contacts** — "What's Jordan's email address?"

**Find people** — "Who do I know at Acme Corp?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Google Calendar & Contacts
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your calendars and contacts
4. Select which calendars to include

You choose which calendars and contact groups we can see.

## How We Use It

When you ask about your schedule, we check your connected calendars. Availability,
upcoming meetings, and conflicts become part of the conversation.

When you mention someone or need contact details, we search your Google Contacts.
Contact information joins the conversation naturally.

Creating events requires confirmation. We show you the details before adding anything to
your calendar.

## Example Conversations

_"What's on my calendar today?"_

_"Am I free for lunch on Friday?"_

_"Schedule a project kickoff for Monday morning"_

_"What's the phone number for the contractor we hired?"_

_"Find my contact for the Henderson project"_

## Context for Conversations

Calendar and contact awareness makes other conversations smarter. When discussing
meeting prep, we know what's coming up and who's attending. When tracking commitments,
we know your time constraints and can reference the right people.

## Privacy

We access only calendars and contact groups you've authorized. Event details and contact
information are used for context, not stored permanently. Credentials are encrypted.
Disconnect anytime.
