# GitHub Integration

Connect GitHub to Carmenta. Access repositories, issues, and pull requests through
natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

**View repositories** — "Show me the repos I've been active in"

**Check issues** — "What issues are assigned to me?"

**Review PRs** — "What pull requests need my review?"

**Search code** — "Find where we handle authentication in the main repo"

**Get context** — Pull code snippets and discussions into conversations

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to GitHub
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your account
4. Select which repositories to include

Access is scoped to repositories you authorize.

## How We Use It

When you discuss development work, we can pull context from GitHub. Code structure,
issue discussions, and PR status become part of the conversation.

This integration is read-focused. We help you understand code and track work; making
changes happens through your normal development workflow.

## Example Conversations

_"What's the status of the feature branch PR?"_

_"Check if there are any open security issues"_

_"What changes went into the last release?"_

_"Find the commit that introduced the bug"_

## For Development Conversations

GitHub context makes technical conversations richer. Discussing a bug? We can reference
the issue. Planning work? We know what's in flight. Reviewing architecture? We can look
at the actual code.

## Privacy

We access only repositories you've authorized. Code is read for context, not stored.
Credentials are encrypted at rest. Disconnect anytime to revoke access.
