# Google Contacts Integration

Connect Google Contacts to Carmenta. Access contact information and relationship context
through natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

**Look up contacts** — "What's Sarah's email address?"

**Find people** — "Search my contacts for anyone at Acme Corp"

**Get context** — "What do I know about John from marketing?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Google Contacts
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your contacts

We request read-only access to your contact list.

## How We Use It

When you mention people, we can look up their details from your contacts. Phone numbers,
emails, companies, and notes become available context.

This is particularly useful combined with your profile's People section. Contacts
provide the basics; your knowledge base adds the relationship context.

## Example Conversations

_"What's the client's phone number?"_

_"Find contacts from the conference last month"_

_"Look up everyone I know at the partner company"_

## Privacy

We access contacts when you ask. No bulk export or browsing. Contact details are used
for context, not stored separately. Credentials are encrypted. Disconnect anytime.
