# Dropbox Integration

> This integration is in beta. Request access through Settings → Integrations.

Connect Dropbox and we bring your files into the conversation. Search, browse folders,
and share links through natural dialogue.

## What You Can Do

**Search files** — "Find my Dropbox files about the Q4 budget"

**Browse folders** — "What's in my Dropbox Documents folder?"

**Download files** — Access file contents for analysis and discussion

**Create shared links** — "Create a share link for that proposal document"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Dropbox
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your Dropbox
4. Select which folders to allow access to

You control the scope. We only see folders you've authorized.

## How We Use It

When you ask about files or documents, we search your authorized Dropbox folders for
relevant content. Files flow into the conversation as context.

We can read, search, and create share links. File uploads from Carmenta to Dropbox are
not currently supported.

## Example Conversations

_"Find my proposal documents in Dropbox"_

_"What files did I add to Dropbox this week?"_

_"Get a share link for the quarterly report"_

_"Search Dropbox for anything mentioning the Henderson project"_

## Privacy

We access only folders you've authorized. Credentials are encrypted. Disconnect anytime
from Settings → Integrations.
