# Gmail Integration

> This integration requires additional authorization. Gmail uses restricted Google API
> scopes that need verification. Contact us for access.

Connect Gmail and we bring your email into the conversation. Search your inbox, read
messages, and draft responses naturally.

## What You Can Do

**Search email** — "Find emails from the client about the contract"

**Read messages** — Access email content directly in conversation

**Draft responses** — "Help me draft a reply to this email"

**Check inbox** — "What important emails came in today?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Gmail
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your account
4. Review and accept permissions

We request read access for search and drafting. Sending requires explicit authorization.

## How We Use It

When you ask about email, we search your inbox for relevant messages. Content joins the
conversation as context for discussing or responding.

Drafts are shown to you before sending. We won't send email without your confirmation.

## Example Conversations

_"Find the email thread about the partnership proposal"_

_"What did the vendor say about pricing?"_

_"Draft a follow-up email to thank them for the meeting"_

_"Search my email for anything from legal about the NDA"_

## Privacy

We access only what's needed to answer your questions. No bulk browsing of your inbox.
Credentials are encrypted at rest. Disconnect anytime to revoke access.
