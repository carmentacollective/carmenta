# ClickUp Integration

Connect ClickUp to Carmenta. Manage tasks and projects through natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

**View tasks** — "What tasks are assigned to me?"

**Create tasks** — "Create a task for the bug we just discussed"

**Update status** — "Mark the homepage task as complete"

**Search projects** — "Find tasks in the Q4 sprint that are blocked"

**Check priorities** — "What's the highest priority task I should work on?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to ClickUp
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your workspace
4. Select which spaces to include

You control scope. Only selected spaces are accessible.

## How We Use It

When you discuss work or ask about tasks, we can check ClickUp for relevant context.
Status updates, assignments, and deadlines become part of the conversation.

Creating and updating tasks happens with your confirmation. We'll show you what we're
about to do before doing it.

## Example Conversations

_"What's the status of the API migration project?"_

_"Create a task in Engineering for the performance fix"_

_"Move all my tasks from this week to next week"_

_"Show me overdue tasks in the marketing space"_

## Integration with AI Team

ClickUp is particularly useful for commitment tracking. When you mention something you
need to do, we can create a task to ensure it doesn't get lost. The AI team uses ClickUp
to coordinate follow-ups and deadlines.

## Privacy

We access only spaces you've authorized. Credentials are encrypted at rest. Disconnect
anytime to revoke access.
