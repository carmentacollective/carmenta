# Spotify Integration

Connect Spotify and your music flows into the conversation. Search for songs, check
what's playing, control playback, explore your listening history.

Music is part of your context. What you're listening to. What you're in the mood for.
What helps you focus. Let's talk about it.

## What You Can Do

**Search music** — "Find songs by The National" or "Search for albums about space"

**See what's playing** — "What's currently playing on Spotify?"

**Control playback** — "Play my Discover Weekly" or "Skip to the next track"

**Explore your taste** — "What are my top artists this month?" or "Show my recently
played tracks"

**Browse playlists** — "Show my playlists" or "What's in my workout playlist?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Spotify
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your Spotify account
4. Start asking about your music

## How We Use It

When you ask about music, we'll search Spotify together. Tracks, albums, artists,
playlists, podcasts, episodes—all accessible in the conversation.

For playback control (play, pause, skip), you need Spotify Premium. Free users can still
search and browse.

## Example Conversations

_"What's my most played song this year?"_

_"Search Spotify for focus music playlists"_

_"Play some jazz while I work"_

_"What have I been listening to lately?"_

_"Pause the music"_

_"Show me my top 10 artists from the last 6 months"_

## Playback Control

Playback commands require:

1. **Spotify Premium** — Free accounts can't control playback via the API
2. **Active device** — Spotify needs to be open somewhere (phone, desktop, web)

If you get errors about playback, check that Spotify is running on at least one device.

## Privacy

Your Spotify data stays with you. We access it only when you ask, and nothing gets saved
to your knowledge base unless you explicitly choose to remember it. Disconnect anytime
in Settings.
