# X (Twitter) Integration

> This integration is in beta. Request access through Settings → Integrations.

Connect X and we help you stay present on the platform. Post tweets, search your
timeline, and engage—all through natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

**Post tweets** — "Tweet: Just shipped a new feature!"

**Search tweets** — "Search my timeline for discussions about AI"

**View timeline** — "What's happening on my X feed?"

**Check mentions** — "Show me my recent mentions"

**Engage** — Like and retweet content you've found

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to X (Twitter)
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your account
4. Grant the permissions you're comfortable with

You control the scope. Read-only access is available if you prefer not to post through
Carmenta.

## How We Use It

When you ask about X or want to post, we interact with your connected account. Posting
always requires confirmation—we show you the tweet before it goes live.

Search and timeline features help you stay informed without switching apps.

## Example Conversations

_"Draft a tweet about the product launch"_

_"What are people saying about [topic] on X?"_

_"Show me my mentions from today"_

_"Like that tweet about the conference"_

## Privacy

We access only what you've authorized. Posts require confirmation before publishing.
Credentials are encrypted. Disconnect anytime.
