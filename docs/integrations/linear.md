# Linear Integration

Connect Linear to Carmenta. Issue tracking for engineering teams, accessible through
natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

**View issues** — "Show me my assigned issues"

**Create issues** — "Create an issue for the memory leak we found"

**Update status** — "Move the auth bug to In Progress"

**Query backlogs** — "What's in the backlog for the mobile team?"

**Check cycles** — "What's left in the current sprint?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Linear
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your workspace
4. Select which teams to include

Access is scoped to teams you authorize.

## How We Use It

When you discuss engineering work, we can pull context from Linear. Issue status, sprint
progress, and team workload become part of the conversation.

Creating and updating issues requires confirmation. We show you the details before
making changes.

## Example Conversations

_"What issues are blocking the release?"_

_"Create a bug for the crash on login"_

_"Who's working on the checkout flow?"_

_"What did we ship in the last cycle?"_

## For Engineering Teams

Linear's clean issue model works well with Carmenta. Track bugs as they come up in
conversation. Check status without context-switching. Keep sprint awareness in your
flow.

## Privacy

We access only teams you've authorized. Credentials are encrypted at rest. Disconnect
anytime to revoke access.
