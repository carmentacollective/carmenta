# Google Drive Integration

Connect Google Drive to Carmenta. Access documents, spreadsheets, and files through
natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

**Search files** — "Find my presentation about the product strategy"

**Read documents** — Access content from Docs, Sheets, and Slides

**List folders** — "What's in my project folder?"

**Get context** — Pull document content into conversations

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Google Drive
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your Drive
4. Select which folders to include (optional)

You control the scope. We can access everything or just specific folders.

## How We Use It

When you ask about files or documents, we search your connected Drive. Document content
becomes context for the conversation.

This is read-heavy. We find and read files; creating or modifying them happens with
explicit confirmation.

## Example Conversations

_"Find my budget spreadsheet"_

_"What does my project plan say about the timeline?"_

_"Search my Drive for the contract template"_

_"What presentations do I have about the new feature?"_

## Privacy

We access only what you've authorized. File searches are scoped to your connected
folders. Credentials are encrypted at rest. Disconnect anytime to revoke access.
