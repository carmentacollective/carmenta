market caps, volume—ask naturally and we pull the numbers.

## What You Can Do

**Check prices** — "What's the current Bitcoin price?"

**Get market data** — "Show me the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap"

**Research tokens** — "Tell me about Ethereum—market cap, volume, recent performance"

**Convert prices** — "How much is 0.5 ETH in USD?"

## How We Use It

Data includes current prices, market cap, 24h volume, circulating supply, and percentage
changes.
