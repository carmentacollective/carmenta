# Notion Integration

Connect your Notion workspace to Carmenta. Access your notes, databases, and
documentation through natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

**Search and find** — "Find my Notion doc about the Q4 roadmap"

**Read content** — Access pages and database entries directly

**Query databases** — "Show me all tasks in my project tracker that are due this week"

**Create pages** — "Create a new page in my meeting notes database"

**Update content** — Modify existing pages and database entries

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Notion
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your workspace
4. Select which pages and databases to share

You control what Carmenta can see. Only shared pages and databases are accessible.

## How We Use It

When you mention Notion or ask about your docs, we search your connected workspace for
relevant content. Results are pulled into the conversation as context.

We read more than we write. Creating or updating content happens with your confirmation
unless you've authorized autonomous action.

## Example Conversations

_"What did I write in my product strategy doc?"_

_"Find my meeting notes from last Thursday"_

_"Add a new entry to my reading list database"_

_"Search my Notion for anything about the API redesign"_

## Privacy

Only pages you explicitly share are accessible. We don't browse your entire workspace.
Credentials are encrypted at rest. Disconnect anytime to revoke access.
