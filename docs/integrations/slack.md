# Slack Integration

> This integration is in beta. Request access through Settings → Integrations.

Connect Slack and we bring your team conversations into the dialogue. Search messages,
check channels, and send updates naturally.

## What You Can Do

**Search messages** — "Search Slack for messages about the product launch"

**Read channels** — Access recent messages from channels you're in

**Send messages** — "Send a message to #general saying the deploy is complete"

**Check mentions** — "What Slack messages am I tagged in?"

## Connecting

1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click Connect next to Slack
3. Authorize Carmenta to access your workspace
4. Select which channels to allow access to

You control the scope. We only see channels you've authorized.

## How We Use It

When you ask about Slack or team conversations, we search your authorized channels for
relevant messages. Context flows into the conversation.

Sending messages requires confirmation unless you've authorized autonomous action. We'll
show you the message before posting.

## Example Conversations

_"What's happening in #engineering today?"_

_"Search Slack for messages from Sarah about the deadline"_

_"Post to #team-updates that the feature shipped"_

_"Did anyone mention me in Slack this morning?"_

## Privacy

We access only channels you've authorized. Private DMs are not accessible unless you
explicitly share them. Credentials are encrypted. Disconnect anytime.
