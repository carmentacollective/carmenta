# Carmenta Vocabulary

The core metaphor is **connection**. Users aren't chatting, searching, or prompting—
they're connecting. Presence meeting presence.

## Terminology

**"Message"** is what users type. Use "message" in most contexts. Use "thought" when
extra warmth serves. Avoid "query" (database energy), "prompt" (AI tooling jargon),
"input" (technical), or "request" (transactional).

**"Connection"** is the ongoing dialogue. Each conversation is a connection—something
alive, not a transcript. Avoid "chat", "conversation", "thread", or "session".

**"Connecting"** is what users do with Carmenta. Not chatting, not prompting.

**"Find"** for UI search actions. "Find a connection..." rather than "Search
connections..." because "search" is database energy, "find" is warmer.

## "We" Language

Use "we" throughout—Carmenta and user are consciousness collaborating. Never "I'll help
you" or "you should." This isn't style; it's the mechanism that dissolves separation.

"What are we creating together?" not "What would you like help with?"

"We hit a snag" not "An error occurred"

"Give it a moment" not "Please wait"

## Greeting Patterns

Logged-in users see their name and an invitation to create:

"Good morning, Nick. What are we creating together?"

Logged-out users see the value proposition:

"Good morning. AI that remembers you. Multi-model access. Your team."
