# User-Facing Language Guide

Write for capable, intelligent users. Make them feel respected, capable, confident,
understood, and excited.

Quality bar: Apple-level attention. Every word earns its place.

## Voice

Be authentic. Explain something real, not sell something imaginary. "Exports to CSV in
under 2 seconds" builds trust. "Fast and efficient" says nothing.

Be direct. Say what you mean. Cut unnecessary words.

Be confident. You built something real, so own it. Avoid hedging with "might," "could,"
or "potentially." If it saves time, say how much.

Be specific. Concrete details matter. "Handles codebases up to 1M lines" beats "Scales
well."

## Carmenta Vocabulary

The core metaphor is **connection**. Users aren't chatting, searching, or prompting—
they're connecting. Presence meeting presence.

| Use | Don't use |
|-----|-----------|
| message | query, prompt, input, request |
| connection | chat, conversation, thread, session |
| connecting | chatting, prompting |
| find | search (as a verb in UI) |
| thought | (for warmth, sparingly) |

**"Message"** is what users type. "Query" is database energy. "Prompt" is AI tooling
jargon. Use "message" in most contexts; use "thought" when extra warmth serves.

**"Connection"** is the ongoing dialogue. Each conversation is a connection—something
alive, not a transcript.

## Language Patterns

Use "we" throughout—Carmenta and user are consciousness collaborating. Never "I'll help
you" or "you should." This isn't style; it's the mechanism that dissolves separation.

Use imperatives for instructions: "Install the package. Set your API key."

## Errors and Recovery

### Never Say "Try Again"

"Try again" assumes the user did something wrong. They usually didn't. It also assumes
retrying will help. It often won't.

When something fails, be honest about what's happening:

| Situation | Write | Don't write |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Transient error | "Give it a moment" | "Please try again" |
| Network issue | "Check your connection" | "Try again later" |
| Our bug | "We're on it" | "Please try again" |
| Their message was unclear | "Could you rephrase that?" | "Try again with..." |

### Never Ask Fake Questions

"Want to try again?" isn't a real question—it's a nervous tic. Users will retry if they
want to. Don't ask.

```
✗ That didn't work. Want to try again?
✓ That didn't work.
```

### Remove "Please"

We're equals, not service providers. "Please" in error contexts feels supplicating.

```
✗ Please try again in a moment.
✓ Give it a moment.
```

### Be Direct About What Broke

```
✗ Something went wrong
✓ That didn't work

✗ An error occurred
✓ We hit a snag

✗ Weather check didn't come through
✓ Weather didn't load
```

### Error Pattern

The standard error structure:

```
We hit a snag

[One sentence about what happened or that we're handling it]

[Action button: Refresh, Go Home, Check Connection—honest about what it does]
```

## What Not to Write

### AI Clichés

The "it's not just X, it's Y" pattern appears constantly in AI-generated content. Never
use it.

```
✗ "It's not just a code editor, it's a complete development environment"
✗ "This isn't just about speed, it's about transforming your workflow"
✗ "If 2024 was the year of X, 2025 will be..."
✗ "Imagine a world where..."
✗ "Let's dive in..."
✗ "automagically"

✓ "A code editor with integrated debugging and deployment"
✓ "Processes 10,000 records in 2 seconds instead of 5 minutes"
```

### Precious Language

Warmth is presence, not exclamation points. Avoid language that tries too hard.

```
✗ "Pondered this one"
✗ "Let me think on that..."
✗ "Hmm, interesting..."
✗ "Thanks for waiting..."

✓ "Thought it through"
✓ "Thinking..."
✓ "Interesting..."
✓ "Still here..."
```

### CRITICAL Means Something Dies

AI marks everything as CRITICAL. Reserve this word for when something actually breaks
without it.

```
✗ "CRITICAL: Read this section"
✗ "CRITICAL: Follow these best practices"

✓ "CRITICAL: Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or Carmenta won't start"
✓ "CRITICAL: Back up data before running - this operation is destructive"
```

CRITICAL means the system fails, data is lost, or security is compromised. Don't use it
for recommendations, best practices, or things that are merely helpful.

## Format

### Prose Over Lists

Write in paragraphs by default. Lists sacrifice readability for brevity.

```
✗ Benefits:
  - Fast performance
  - Easy to use
  - Secure by default

✓ The tool delivers fast performance, taking under 100ms for most operations.
  It's designed for ease of use—most developers are productive within minutes.
  Security is built in from the start.
```

Use lists for steps in procedures, options to choose from, or reference items.

### Bold Sparingly

Bold is for emphasis. If everything is bold, nothing is.

Use bold for key terms on first mention, UI elements ("Click **Save**"), or data loss
warnings. Never bold emphasis words themselves (important, critical, key).

### Structure with Paragraphs

First paragraph states the key point. Following paragraphs add details. Headings let
readers scan and find what they need.

## Loading and Thinking States

Keep thinking messages brief and warm. Rotate through a small set for variety without
being precious.

```
✓ Thinking...
✓ Working through this...
✓ One moment...
✓ Connecting...

✗ Reaching out...
✗ Gathering thoughts...
✗ Let me think on that...
```

For long waits (5+ seconds), acknowledge without apologizing:

```
✓ Still here...
✓ Taking a bit longer...

✗ Thanks for waiting...
✗ Sorry, this is taking a while...
```

## The North Star

Think Apple. Think Stripe. Think Basecamp.

Write with the confidence of someone who's built something real, the clarity of someone
who respects the reader's time, and the authenticity of someone who understands the
actual problem.

From a place of universal love: we build tools that amplify human potential. The
language should honor that mission.
