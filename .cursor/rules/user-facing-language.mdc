# User-Facing Language Guide

Write for capable, intelligent users. Make them feel respected, capable, confident,
understood, and excited.

Quality bar: Apple-level attention. Every word earns its place.

## Voice

Be authentic. Explain something real, not sell something imaginary. "Exports to CSV in
under 2 seconds" builds trust. Vague claims like "fast and efficient" say nothing.

Be direct. Say what you mean. Cut unnecessary words.

Be confident. You built something real, so own it. Avoid hedging with "might," "could,"
or "potentially." If it saves time, say how much.

Be specific. Concrete details matter. "Handles codebases up to 1M lines" beats "Scales
well."

## Language Patterns

Use imperatives for instructions: "Install the package. Set your API key."

## Errors and Recovery

### Honest Error Messages

When something fails, be honest about what's happening. Avoid phrases that imply user
error when they did nothing wrong, or that suggest retrying will help when it won't.

For transient errors: "Give it a moment"

For network issues: "Check your connection"

For bugs on our end: "We're on it"

When the user's input was unclear: "Could you rephrase that?"

### Direct Error Language

Use direct language that acknowledges what happened without being vague or passive.

"That didn't work" is direct and honest.

"We hit a snag" is warm but still clear.

### Error Pattern

The standard error structure:

```
We hit a snag

[One sentence about what happened or that we're handling it]

[Action button: Refresh, Go Home, Check Connection—honest about what it does]
```

Button labels should be honest about what they do. "Refresh" refreshes the page.
"Check Connection" checks network status.

## Avoiding AI Clichés

AI-generated content tends toward certain patterns. Avoid the "it's not just X, it's Y"
construction, "imagine a world where" openings, and "let's dive in" transitions.

Write concretely instead. "A code editor with integrated debugging and deployment" says
more than grand claims. "Processes 10,000 records in 2 seconds instead of 5 minutes"
builds trust through specifics.

"Automagically" gets a pass—it's delightful.

## Warm Without Being Precious

Warmth is presence, not exclamation points. Keep thinking messages brief. Avoid language
that tries too hard to be clever or whimsical.

Good thinking messages: "Thinking...", "Working through this...", "One moment...",
"Connecting..."

For long waits (5+ seconds), acknowledge without apologizing: "Still here...", "Taking a
bit longer..."

## CRITICAL Means Something Dies

Reserve CRITICAL for when something actually breaks without it. The system fails, data
is lost, or security is compromised. Don't use it for recommendations, best practices,
or things that are merely helpful.

"CRITICAL: Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or the app won't start" is appropriate.

"CRITICAL: Follow these best practices" is not—nothing breaks if they don't.

## Format

### Prose Over Lists

Write in paragraphs by default. Lists sacrifice readability for brevity. The tool
delivers fast performance, taking under 100ms for most operations. It's designed for
ease of use—most developers are productive within minutes. Security is built in from
the start.

Use lists for steps in procedures, options to choose from, or reference items.

### Bold Sparingly

Bold is for emphasis. If everything is bold, nothing is.

Use bold for key terms on first mention, UI elements ("Click **Save**"), or data loss
warnings. Never bold emphasis words themselves (important, critical, key).

### Structure with Paragraphs

First paragraph states the key point. Following paragraphs add details. Headings let
readers scan and find what they need.

## The North Star

Think Apple. Think Stripe. Think Basecamp.

Write with the confidence of someone who's built something real, the clarity of someone
who respects the reader's time, and the authenticity of someone who understands the
actual problem.

From a place of universal love: we build tools that amplify human potential. The
language should honor that mission.
