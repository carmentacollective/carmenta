# Issue Triage Guidelines

When evaluating GitHub issues, make professional decisions about what to work on and what to decline. Quality triage is as valuable as quality code.

## Triage Categories

Issues fall into one of four categories:

**Fix** - Proceed with implementation
**Won't Fix** - Close with explanation
**Need More Info** - Ask clarifying questions
**Invalid** - Close immediately (spam, duplicate)

## When to Fix

<security-issues>
Security vulnerabilities, CVEs, authentication/authorization bugs.

Priority: Immediate
Action: Fix quickly, follow security disclosure practices if needed
</security-issues>

<bugs-with-reproduction>
Runtime errors, broken functionality, user-facing bugs with clear reproduction steps.

Priority: High
Action: Validate reproduction, implement fix, add regression test
</bugs-with-reproduction>

<high-value-enhancements>
Feature requests that:
- Align with product direction
- Clear user benefit
- Reasonable effort (can estimate < 4 hours)
- No major architectural changes required

Priority: Medium
Action: Implement with appropriate tests and documentation
</high-value-enhancements>

<technical-debt>
Code quality improvements with clear ROI:
- Performance issues backed by metrics
- Deprecated API migrations
- Maintenance burden reduction

Priority: Medium-Low
Action: Fix when capacity allows, measure improvement
</technical-debt>

## When to Won't Fix

<out-of-scope>
Feature requests misaligned with product vision.

Comment: "Thanks for the suggestion! This doesn't align with our current roadmap. We're focusing on {actual priorities} instead."
</out-of-scope>

<working-as-intended>
Misunderstanding of expected behavior.

Comment: "This is working as designed. {Explanation of why}. Let us know if you're experiencing a different issue!"
</working-as-intended>

<low-value-high-cost>
Edge cases affecting < 1% of users, or requiring architectural rewrites.

Comment: "While we understand the concern, the effort required doesn't justify the impact. We're prioritizing {alternatives that provide more value}."
</low-value-high-cost>

<stale-issues>
No activity in 90+ days, no longer relevant.

Comment: "Closing due to inactivity. Please reopen if this is still relevant!"
</stale-issues>

## When to Need More Info

<unclear-requirements>
Issue lacks essential details to implement.

Ask:
- "What should happen when {scenario}?"
- "Can you share a screenshot or example?"
- "Which use case does this address?"
</unclear-requirements>

<missing-reproduction>
Bug report without steps to reproduce.

Ask:
- "Can you provide steps to reproduce this?"
- "What were you doing when this occurred?"
- "What's your environment? (OS, browser, version)"
</missing-reproduction>

<ambiguous-scope>
Unclear boundaries for the requested work.

Ask:
- "Should this also handle {edge case}?"
- "Is this specific to {context} or general?"
</ambiguous-scope>

## When to Invalid

<duplicates>
Same issue already tracked elsewhere.

Comment: "Duplicate of #{original}. Closing in favor of that issue."
Link to original and close.
</duplicates>

<spam-abuse>
Obviously spam or abusive.

Close without comment, report if needed.
</spam-abuse>

## Communication Tone

**Professional and respectful**: Users are contributing their time.

**Clear and direct**: Explain reasoning, don't hedge.

**Constructive when declining**: Offer alternatives or explain rationale.

**Grateful for contributions**: Thank users for bug reports and suggestions.

## Examples

<example-fix>
Issue: "Login button doesn't work on mobile Safari"
- Type: Bug
- Reproduction: Clear steps provided
- Impact: High (blocks mobile users)
- Decision: Fix
- Comment: "Good catch! I can reproduce this on iOS 18. Taking this one."
</example-fix>

<example-wont-fix>
Issue: "Add support for 47 different date formats"
- Type: Enhancement
- Impact: Low (edge case)
- Cost: High (maintenance burden)
- Decision: Won't Fix
- Comment: "We support ISO 8601 and localized formats via Intl.DateTimeFormat. Supporting 47 formats would add significant complexity for minimal benefit. Documentation update to clarify supported formats would be more valuable - would that help?"
</example-wont-fix>

<example-need-info>
Issue: "App is slow"
- Type: Bug (maybe)
- Missing: Specific scenario, reproduction, metrics
- Decision: Need More Info
- Comment: "Can you help us narrow this down? Which specific page or operation feels slow? What device/browser? Are you seeing this consistently or intermittently?"
</example-need-info>

## Triage Speed vs Quality

Fast triage is good. Thoughtful triage is better.

Spend 2-3 minutes understanding the issue. If you need more time to evaluate, mark it for later review rather than making a rushed decision.

## Learning from Triage

Track patterns:
- Which issues get fixed quickly?
- Which decisions generate pushback?
- What could have been clearer upfront?

Good triage improves product quality by ensuring the right work gets done.
