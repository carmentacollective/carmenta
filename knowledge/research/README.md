# Model Research Archive

Deep research into the LLM landscape to inform `knowledge/model-rubric.md`.

## Purpose

The model rubric is our source of truth for routing decisions. This folder contains the
detailed research that validates those decisions - benchmark data, pricing verification,
capability analysis, and competitive intelligence.

## Structure

Files named by date: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

Each research document should include:

- **Sources cited**: Primary sources (APIs, leaderboards, official docs)
- **Verification method**: How claims were validated
- **Key findings**: What changed, what stayed the same
- **Recommendations**: What to update in the rubric (if anything)

## Research Cadence

Run deep research when:

- Major model releases (GPT 5.x, Claude 4.x, Gemini 3.x)
- Significant leaderboard shifts
- User feedback suggests routing isn't optimal
- Quarterly validation (ensure rubric reflects reality)

## Using Research

When updating the rubric:

1. Read latest research document
2. Verify claims still hold (check dates, sources)
3. Update rubric with verified findings only
4. Add version entry to rubric's Update Log
5. Archive research here for future reference

The rubric is the product. This folder is the receipts.
