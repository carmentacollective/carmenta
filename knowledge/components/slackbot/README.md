# Carmenta Slackbot

Carmenta's presence in Slack - not a command responder, but a proactive community
member.

This is a significant component with multiple dimensions, documented across several
files:

## Documents

### [Vision](./vision.md)

Core identity and purpose. What the Slackbot IS, why it exists, what makes it distinctly
Carmenta.

### [Best of Breed](./best-of-breed.md)

Research synthesis on what excellence looks like. Patterns from the best Slack bots,
community management practices, and enterprise examples that inform our approach.

### [Moonshots](./moonshots.md)

Wild ideas. Creative features that no one's built yet. The "what if" document for when
we want to push boundaries.

### [Architecture](./architecture.md)

Technical implementation. How it connects to existing infrastructure, event handling,
the Bolt framework, and integration with Carmenta's existing Slack adapter.

## Context

This isn't just "a bot." It's Carmenta showing up in a community space - with her
personality, her values, her way of being present. The same goddess who protects
transformation in the interface now walks among the community.

Strategic context: Potential Salesforce acquisition interest makes this component
valuable both as product and as proof of AI-native community management.
