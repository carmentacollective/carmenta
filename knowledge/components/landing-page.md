# Landing Page

The M0 landing page. Pure vision articulation, no product functionality.

## Why This Exists

This is the stake in the ground. Before there's a product, there's a philosophy. The
landing page communicates what we're building and why—giving The Curious a reason to
pay attention and follow along.

If the vision resonates, people will find their way to the GitHub. If it doesn't, no
signup form or CTA would save us.

## Goals

1. **Communicate the vision** - What Carmenta is, who it's for, why it matters
2. **Establish differentiation** - Why this isn't "yet another AI wrapper"
3. **Signal seriousness** - This is a real project with clear thinking, not vaporware
4. **Enable following** - People who resonate can find the GitHub to watch progress

## Target Audience

The Curious (see [personas.md](../product/personas.md)): GitHub followers, newsletter subscribers, indie hackers,
AI enthusiasts. People drowning in AI tools, skeptical of wrappers, but open to
something with a clear philosophy.

They need to quickly understand why this is different. They don't need feature lists
or pricing—they need to feel whether this resonates.

## Content Requirements

The page must communicate:

- **What Carmenta is** - An AI interface, not another chatbot wrapper
- **Who it's for** - Builders who use AI constantly and feel the fragmentation
- **The problem we're solving** - Context lost across tools, conversations that don't
  persist, explaining yourself repeatedly
- **Our approach** - Partnership over tool-use, "we" philosophy, AI that remembers
- **The name meaning** - Carmenta as goddess of technology, connection to human
  flourishing

## Tone

- Heart-centered "we" language throughout
- Confident without being boastful (no "best" claims)
- Assumes the reader already uses AI daily—doesn't explain basics
- Brief, every word earns its place
- Feels different from typical SaaS landing pages

## What's NOT on This Page

- Email capture or waitlist signup
- Feature lists or capability promises
- Screenshots or product demos
- Pricing or plans
- "Coming soon" or launch dates
- Social proof or testimonials
- Comparisons to specific competitors
- Multiple CTAs competing for attention

## Visual Direction

Wireframe aesthetic. Intentionally minimal. The words do the work, not the design.
This signals "early stage, clear thinking" rather than "polished but shallow."

No one should judge the design because it's obvious the design isn't the point yet.

## GitHub Link

Present but not promoted. A simple icon in the footer, not a "Star us on GitHub!" CTA.
For people who want to follow along, not as a metric we're optimizing.

## Technical Requirements

- Static page, no backend
- Fast load, minimal assets
- Semantic HTML, accessible
- Responsive (works on mobile)
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Favicon

## Success Criteria

Qualitative, not conversion-based:

1. Someone finishes reading and can explain what Carmenta is
2. The tone feels different from typical product pages
3. Builders share it because the philosophy resonates
4. We'd be proud to send this link to someone we respect

## Integration Points

- **Hosting**: Deployed via Render with the main application
- **GitHub**: Links to public repo (repo must be in presentable state)

## Resolved

- **Domain**: https://carmenta.ai
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/carmentacollective/carmenta

## Open Questions

- **GitHub repo state**: What should be visible when people click through? README
  content, visible knowledge/ folder, commit history?
- **Social sharing**: OG image, preview text for when people share the link? (not set
  up yet—can defer or make part of M0 deliverables)
