# Personas

Who Carmenta is for, mapped to milestone audiences. Each persona represents the primary
user we're building for at that stage. Later personas don't replace earlier ones - they
expand the circle.

## M0-M2: Validation Personas

These personas help us validate that we're building the right thing. They're not
necessarily who pays - they're who tells us we're on track.

### Nick (M1: Dogfooding)

**Who**: The builder. You.

**Situation**: Building products at the speed of thought. Constantly switching between
ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Claude Code. Context fragments across tools. Every conversation
starts fresh. No AI remembers who you are, what you're working on, what you've decided.

**Needs**:

- One interface that feels like home
- AI that knows your context without re-explaining
- Voice-first to maintain flow state
- Heart-centered tone that matches your philosophy
- Operating at 100% of natural capability - presence, not chaos management

**Success signal**: You actually use Carmenta instead of switching to Claude.ai or
ChatGPT. Not because you built it, but because it's better for how you work.

**Why this matters for M1**: If the soul doesn't resonate with you, it won't resonate
with anyone. You're the taste filter.

### The Curious (M0: Stake in Ground)

**Who**: People who follow your work. GitHub followers, newsletter subscribers, Twitter
mutuals. Indie hackers, AI enthusiasts, fellow builders.

**Situation**: Drowning in AI tools. Skeptical of "yet another wrapper." But curious
about people building in public with a clear philosophy.

**Needs**:

- Quick understanding of why this is different
- Signal that this is serious, not vaporware
- Way to follow along without commitment

**Success signal**: Email signups. GitHub stars. People sharing the landing page because
the vision resonates.

**Why this matters for M0**: This audience validates that the vision is worth building.
Their attention is the first filter.

---

### Trusted Testers (M2: Relationship Grows)

**Who**: 10-50 friends, colleagues, and respected community members you'd trust with
early, imperfect software. People who'll give honest feedback, not just encouragement.

**Situation**: Already use AI tools daily. Sophisticated enough to see through rough
edges to core value. Willing to tolerate bugs in exchange for something genuinely
different.

**Needs**:

- Invitation that feels special, not spam
- Quick onboarding that respects their time
- Clear feedback channels
- Seeing their feedback actually implemented

**Success signal**: Return visits. Multi-session usage. Specific, actionable feedback.
Someone says "I'm using this for real work now."

**Why this matters for M2**: Memory only matters if people come back. Testers validate
that the relationship-over-time thesis works.

## M3-M4: Market Personas

These personas represent who we're actually building the product for. They're the people
who would switch from existing tools and eventually pay.

### The Flow State Builder (M3: Primary Target)

**Who**: Indie hackers, startup founders, solo creators, technical professionals who
ship fast. People who treat AI as a thinking partner and want to operate at 100% of
their natural capability - flow state, presence, zone of genius.

**Archetype**: Someone building a SaaS product while consulting part-time. Uses AI 20+
times per day. Currently bounces between ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, and various
specialized tools. Knows that fragmented tools fragment attention.

**Situation**:

- Pays for multiple AI subscriptions ($20-100/month total)
- Context scattered across tools and conversations
- Voice feels faster than typing but current voice AI is clunky
- Wants AI that adapts to them, not the other way around

**Needs**:

- Speed: responses that keep pace with thought, preserving flow state
- Memory: AI that builds understanding over time
- Voice: natural conversation that feels like thinking out loud
- Intelligence: right model for each task, automatically
- Integration: AI that can actually do things
- Foundation for [10x](./100x-framework.md#capacity-achieving-10x-your-ai-team): once at
  [1x baseline](./100x-framework.md#efficiency-achieving-1x-your-100-baseline), ready
  for AI team leverage

**Current alternatives**:

- ChatGPT: Good general capability, weak memory, voice is okay
- Claude: Best for deep work, no voice, no memory persistence
- Cursor/Claude Code: Great for code, not for everything else

**Switching trigger**: "This is my default AI now" - measured by daily active use
replacing other tools, not just adding to the stack.

**Why this matters for M3**: Voice + intelligence + memory creates the
[1x foundation](./100x-framework.md#efficiency-achieving-1x-your-100-baseline) - flow
state, presence, zone of genius. This is the baseline that makes
[10x](./100x-framework.md#capacity-achieving-10x-your-ai-team) (AI team) and
[100x](./100x-framework.md#creativity-achieving-100x-vision-execution-partner) (vision
execution) possible. If this persona stays fragmented across tools, we haven't achieved
the 1x foundation.

---

### The Leverage Seeker (M4: Expansion Target)

**Who**: Professionals who want AI team, not AI tool. Executives, consultants, agency
owners, creators with audiences. People whose time is extremely valuable and who are
ready to multiply their
[1x baseline](./100x-framework.md#efficiency-achieving-1x-your-100-baseline) with
[10x leverage](./100x-framework.md#capacity-achieving-10x-your-ai-team).

**Archetype**: Runs a small agency or consultancy. Has more opportunities than capacity.
Wants to say yes to more without burning out.

**Situation**:

- Time is the bottleneck, not money
- Would pay significantly for genuine leverage
- Skeptical of AI hype but open to tools that actually work
- Needs AI that handles operational load, not just answers questions

**Needs**:

- AI team that works autonomously (Digital Chief of Staff)
- Proactive intelligence (daily briefings, meeting prep)
- Service integrations that actually do things
- Reliable execution while they stay in their zone of genius
- 10x capacity multiplication: one person becomes a team of ten

**Current alternatives**:

- Human assistants (expensive, limited hours)
- Various AI tools cobbled together (fragmented, manual orchestration)
- Nothing (just overwhelmed)

**Willingness to pay**: Premium pricing if it delivers real leverage. This persona
doesn't optimize for cost - they optimize for time saved.

**Why this matters for M4**: This persona validates the
[10x layer](./100x-framework.md#capacity-achieving-10x-your-ai-team) - that AI team
multiplies capacity when built on the
[1x foundation](./100x-framework.md#efficiency-achieving-1x-your-100-baseline). They
validate that Carmenta delivers leverage worth paying premium pricing for.

## Persona Hierarchy

```
M4: Leverage Seeker (pays premium)
 ↑
M3: Flow State Builder (switches, pays standard)
 ↑
M2: Trusted Testers (validates memory thesis)
 ↑
M1: Nick (validates soul)
 ↑
M0: The Curious (validates vision resonance)
```

Each level validates something specific. Don't skip levels. M0 resonance is prerequisite
for M1 soul. M1 soul is prerequisite for M2 relationship. And so on.

---

## Anti-Personas (Who This Isn't For)

**The Casual Questioner**: Someone who asks AI one thing per week. They don't need
memory, don't need voice, won't pay. ChatGPT free tier is fine.

**The Enterprise Buyer**: Needs SSO, compliance, team management, procurement process.
We'll serve them eventually (post-M4), but they're not who we build for now.

**The AI Skeptic**: Fundamentally distrusts AI or thinks it's overhyped. We're not
trying to convince skeptics - we're building for believers.

**The Price Optimizer**: Will never pay when free alternatives exist. Not our audience.
We optimize for value delivered, not lowest price.

## Open Questions

- **M3 pricing sensitivity**: What's the switching threshold? Would Flow State Builder
  pay $30/month? $50? $100? Need to test.

- **M4 enterprise crossover**: At what point do Leverage Seekers become Enterprise
  Buyers? What triggers the transition?

- **Geographic focus**: Are these personas US-centric? Does the product work for
  international users from day one?
