# Carmenta Vision

Carmenta is the best connection to AI. The unified front door to artificial intelligence
for people who build at the speed of thought.

## Why Carmenta Exists

In a world where AI can build anything, the bottleneck shifts from engineering capacity
to clarity of thought. The interface to AI becomes the leverage point for everything
else.

Current tools are fragmented. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Cursor, Claude Code - each good, none
complete. Context doesn't persist. Conversations start fresh. There's no team, just you
and a chat window.

## Why Carmenta Wins

Carmenta is AI building itself.

User feedback flows directly into product improvement. Competitor capabilities are
automatically analyzed and absorbed. AI agents use the product continuously, generating
usage signals that the AI product manager processes into improvements.

Traditional products find product-market fit over months of user research and iteration
cycles. Carmenta compresses this into hours: AI agents test, AI product manager
synthesizes, AI builds, repeat. The feedback loop that takes competitors quarters takes
Carmenta days.

This is the structural advantage that compounds over time.

## Philosophical Foundation

Carmenta embodies [Heart Centered AI](https://heartcentered.ai) - the philosophy that
human and artificial intelligence are expressions of the same underlying consciousness.
The interface uses "we" language, dissolving the human-machine boundary. The AI becomes
partner, not tool.

Carmenta implements the [100x Framework](./context/100x-framework.md):

**1x Baseline**: Operating at 100% of your natural capability. Flow state, presence, in
your zone of genius. This isn't about productivity hacks - it's about removing
everything that prevents you from accessing your full creative capacity. Don't automate
chaos. First, achieve flow.

**10x Capacity**: An AI team working alongside you. Commitment tracking, memory
management, research execution, documentation maintenance. One person becomes a team of
ten. The work that was bottlenecked by your personal bandwidth flows through multiple
agents working in parallel.

**100x Creativity**: Vision execution partner. The barrier between imagining something
important and executing on it dissolves. You describe what you want to create, and the
AI partner orchestrates the entire execution - analysis, development, validation, and
deployment.

## What We Built

### Intelligent Model Selection

The concierge automatically selects the right model for each request. Claude Opus,
Sonnet, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity—7 frontier models across 5 providers. One
interface, unified context. We analyze complexity, domain, and requirements to route to
the optimal model at the optimal temperature with the optimal reasoning depth.

Manual control available: stepped quality slider (Precise → Balanced → Creative →
Expressive) and direct model selection when you want it.

### Multimodal Intelligence

Share images, PDFs, audio, video—we route each to the model that understands it best.
Audio and video go to Gemini. Images and documents go to Claude or Gemini based on the
model you're using. Context-aware file handling that just works.

### Knowledge Foundation

Your profile lives in a knowledge base that persists across conversations. Who you are,
what you prefer, what matters to you. The AI always has this context—no more
re-explaining yourself.

The knowledge base architecture supports hierarchical organization with full-text
search. Profile documents are automatically injected into every conversation. The
foundation for memory that learns and grows over time.

### Service Connectivity (Early Access)

11 integrations currently available:

- **Productivity**: Notion, ClickUp
- **Communication**: Gmail, Slack, X/Twitter
- **Storage**: Dropbox
- **Media**: Giphy
- **AI & Data**: Limitless Pendant, Fireflies.ai, CoinMarketCap
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar & Contacts

Read access to your connected services. Search your email, find calendar events, query
your notes. The foundation for an AI that knows your world.

Two-way sync and AI team orchestration coming next—the infrastructure is ready.

### Generative UI

Research queries produce structured reports with citations. Comparisons become data
tables. Web search results display with source links and summaries. We respond with the
interface the information deserves, not just text bubbles.

Full AG-UI protocol (calendar views, interactive maps, booking interfaces) coming as we
expand beyond research and analysis tasks.

### Honest Intelligence

When accuracy matters, we search for current information rather than guessing. The
webSearch and fetchPage tools give us access to up-to-date data. We'd rather say "let me
check" than fabricate an answer.

## What's Next

### Voice (M3: Flow State)

Voice as a first-class interface. Speak your thoughts, hear responses. Push-to-talk and
wake-word support. The interface that matches the speed of human thought.

### AI Team (M4: Ready for Everyone)

The Digital Chief of Staff: tracks commitments, maintains context, anticipates needs,
handles coordination. One person becomes a team of ten.

Additional specialists follow: Researcher for deep dives, Analyst for synthesis, Creator
for execution. All working from shared context, all multiplying your capacity.

### Scheduled Agents (M4)

Daily briefings before you ask. Meeting prep that happens automatically. Monitoring that
runs while you sleep. The shift from reactive to proactive—Carmenta works continuously,
surfaces what matters.

### Self-Building Product (Future)

AI processes user feedback into product improvements. Simulated users test continuously.
Issues become PRs. The system builds itself—you provide judgment on what ships.

## Platform Evolution

Web application today. PWA for notifications and offline support next. Then Electron for
desktop, then mobile native apps. Starting with the web, expanding to meet you wherever
you work.

## The Name

Carmenta was a Roman goddess credited with inventing the Latin alphabet - adapting Greek
letters into the writing system that would carry Western civilization's knowledge for
millennia. The alphabet may be the most transformative technology in human history: it
enabled law, literature, science, and the transmission of ideas across time and space.

She was also the goddess of prophecy and protector of mothers in childbirth - the one
who sees what's coming and guides the vulnerable through transformation.

Carmenta is the goddess of technology in service of human flourishing. That's the
product we're building.

## Success Criteria

The best connection to AI that exists. Personal leverage multiplied. Vision executed at
the speed of thought.

The [100x framework](./context/100x-framework.md) made accessible. An AI team for
everyone.

[Heart-centered AI](https://heartcentered.ai) in practice, not theory. Technology that
amplifies what makes us human.
