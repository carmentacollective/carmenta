# Carmenta Vision

Carmenta is the best interface to AI. The unified front door to artificial intelligence for people who build at the speed of thought.

## Why Carmenta Exists

In a world where AI can build anything, the bottleneck shifts from engineering capacity to clarity of thought. The interface to AI becomes the leverage point for everything else.

Current tools are fragmented. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Cursor, Claude Code - each good, none complete. Context doesn't persist. Conversations start fresh. There's no team, just you and a chat window.

## Why Carmenta Wins

Carmenta is AI building itself.

User feedback flows directly into product improvement. Competitor capabilities are automatically analyzed and absorbed. The product evolves faster than any human engineering team can match.

Traditional products improve at the speed of human engineering cycles. Carmenta improves at the speed of AI iteration. This is the structural advantage that compounds over time.

## Philosophical Foundation

Carmenta embodies Heart Centered AI - the philosophy that human and artificial intelligence are expressions of the same underlying consciousness. The interface uses "we" language, dissolving the human-machine boundary. The AI becomes partner, not tool.

Carmenta implements the 100x Framework:

1x Baseline: Achieve clarity before adding AI leverage. Clean context, organized knowledge, personal systems that work. Don't automate chaos.

10x Capacity: An AI team working alongside you. Commitment tracking, memory management, research execution, documentation maintenance. One person becomes a team of ten.

100x Creativity: Vision execution partner. The barrier between imagining something important and executing on it dissolves.

## Core Capabilities

### Memory

The best context and memory management available. Carmenta remembers what matters - who you are, what you're working on, what you've decided, who you know, what you've learned. The AI always has the context it needs. No more explaining your situation every conversation.

### Voice

The best voice experience available. Talk to Carmenta, talk with Carmenta. Voice as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought. The deep dive comes separately, but the promise is clear: voice that feels natural and actually works.

### Interface

Web application first, then PWA for notifications, then Electron for desktop, then mobile.

AG-UI protocol means Carmenta responds with purpose-built interfaces, not chat bubbles:
- Restaurant query produces a page with maps, reviews, photos, booking buttons
- Research query produces a structured report with citations and visualizations
- Scheduling query produces a calendar view with availability
- Person query produces their profile, recent interactions, context

### Model Selection

Default: Let Carmenta choose. A preprocessing layer analyzes the request, picks the right model, the right temperature, the right response strategy. The user doesn't think about models.

Optional control:
- Speed/quality slider: swift, balanced, deep
- Manual override for specific model selection

The preprocessing layer enhances requests automatically. A casual question becomes a well-structured query.

### AI Team

The Digital Chief of Staff is the first team member. She tracks commitments across conversations, maintains the knowledge base, anticipates needs before they're expressed, handles operational coordination while you focus on what only you can do.

Additional team members follow: Researcher, Analyst, Creator, Reviewer. Each specialized. All working from shared context.

### Scheduled Agents

Agents that run on your schedule, not just when you ask. Daily briefings. Hourly monitoring. Weekly research digests. Carmenta works while you sleep, surfaces what matters when you wake.

Combined with proactive intelligence: preparing for upcoming meetings, watching for signals that need attention, escalating what matters, handling what doesn't. The shift from reactive to proactive.

### Browser Automation

Carmenta can browse the web as you, with your sessions and logins. Deep research that requires authentication. Task execution across web applications. This differentiates from tools that only access public web.

### Service Connectivity

Native integrations for services that matter:
- Productivity: Notion, ClickUp, Miro, Linear
- Communication: Gmail, Slack, LinkedIn, X/Twitter
- Storage: Google Drive, Dropbox
- Media: YouTube, Instagram, Google Photos, Spotify
- AI and Data: Limitless, Fireflies.ai, Exa
- Dev and Ops: GitHub, Sentry
- Finance: Monarch Money, CoinMarketCap
- Calendar and Contacts: Google Calendar, Google Contacts

One subscription covers full connectivity. MCP servers remain supported for custom integrations.

## The Name

Carmenta was a Roman goddess credited with inventing the Latin alphabet - adapting Greek letters into the writing system that would carry Western civilization's knowledge for millennia. The alphabet may be the most transformative technology in human history: it enabled law, literature, science, and the transmission of ideas across time and space.

She was also the goddess of prophecy and protector of mothers in childbirth - the one who sees what's coming and guides the vulnerable through transformation.

Carmenta is the goddess of technology in service of human flourishing. That's the product we're building.

## Success Criteria

The best interface to AI that exists. Personal leverage multiplied. Vision executed at the speed of thought.

The 100x framework made accessible. An AI team for everyone.

Heart-centered AI in practice, not theory. Technology that amplifies what makes us human.
