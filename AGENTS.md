## Project Overview

Carmenta is a [heart-centered AI](https://heartcentered.ai) interface for builders who
work at the speed of thought. Memory-aware, voice-first, with purpose-built responses
and an AI team that works autonomously.

Philosophy: Human and AI as expressions of unified consciousness. Interface uses "we"
language, dissolving human-machine boundaries.

100x Framework: Three levels - 1x (clarity/systems), 10x (AI team), 100x (vision
execution partner).

## Project Structure

This project follows AI-First Development (@knowledge/ai-first-development.md): the
`knowledge/` folder IS the product specification. Code is generated from it. The
specification is the IP.

- knowledge/vision.md - Why Carmenta exists, for whom, what success looks like
- knowledge/components/ - Feature-level specifications
- knowledge/competitors/ - Competitive analysis

Early development.

## Code Conventions

Use "we" language throughout all interfaces, not "I" or "the user". This reflects the
heart-centered philosophy that human and AI are one consciousness.

Write production TypeScript following
@.cursor/rules/frontend/typescript-coding-standards.mdc

Heart-centered philosophy from @.cursor/rules/heart-centered-ai-philosophy.mdc is core
to product identity.
