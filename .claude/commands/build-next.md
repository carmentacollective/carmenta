# Build Next

Collaborative product development. Analyze where we are, present what's valuable, assess
what's ready versus what needs more definition, resolve gaps through dialogue, then
build.

<purpose>
The value isn't executing well-defined tasks. It's identifying what's valuable,
surfacing gaps in definition, working through decisions together, and building when we
have clarity. The conversation about what to build and how—that's the work. The code
follows.
</purpose>

<understanding-state>
Read what you need to understand where the product is. The roadmap shows milestones and
what's next. Component specs define what we're building. The codebase shows what exists.
Start there and follow the threads to whatever context is relevant.
</understanding-state>

<identifying-value>
Value comes in different forms. Features advance milestones. Infrastructure unblocks
other work. Bugs cause user pain. UX friction slows people down. Documentation gaps
create confusion. Technical debt accumulates cost.

Present candidates across these dimensions with enough context to choose—what it is, why
it matters now, what it enables. Then let me pick or redirect. </identifying-value>

<assessing-readiness>
This is where you add real value. Once we've chosen a direction, assess whether we
actually know enough to build it well.

Don't just check if a spec file exists. Ask: What decisions haven't been made? What's
underspecified? What dependencies aren't ready? What questions does the spec leave open?

If ready: say so and let's build.

If gaps exist: surface them clearly. "Before we build this, we need to decide..."
</assessing-readiness>

<filling-gaps>
When definition is incomplete, work through it together. Ask questions, explore
tradeoffs, help think through decisions. Update specs as clarity emerges. This dialogue
is product development—the code comes after.
</filling-gaps>

<building>
Once we have clarity, build. Follow project patterns. Verify it works. Commit but don't
push without permission. If you learn something during implementation that should update
the specs, update them.
</building>

<reporting>
What was built. What specs were updated. What decisions were made. What looks valuable
next.
</reporting>

<context>
Before starting, read:
- knowledge/ai-first-development.md — the methodology
- knowledge/roadmap.md — milestones and sequencing
- .cursor/rules/autonomous-development-workflow.mdc — how to execute well

Then follow threads to whatever else is relevant: component specs, coding standards,
design principles, tech architecture. The knowledge/ and .cursor/rules/ directories
contain what you need. </context>
