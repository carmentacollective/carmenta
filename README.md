# Carmenta

A heart centered interface to AI for people who build at the speed of thought.

## Why Carmenta

Current AI tools are fragmented. ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Cursor, Claude Code - each good,
none complete. Context doesn't persist. Conversations start fresh. There's no team, just
you and a chat window.

Carmenta is different. It remembers what matters. It responds with purpose-built
interfaces, not chat bubbles. It works while you sleep. And it improves itself -
processing user feedback, analyzing competitors, running AI agents as users to compress
product-market fit into hours instead of months.

## Philosophy

**[Heart Centered AI](https://heartcentered.ai)** - Human and artificial intelligence as
expressions of the same underlying consciousness. The interface uses "we" language,
dissolving the human-machine boundary. AI as partner, not tool.

**100x Framework** - Three levels of AI leverage:

- _1x Baseline_: Clarity before automation. Clean context, organized knowledge, personal
  systems that work. Don't automate chaos.
- _10x Capacity_: An AI team working alongside you. One person becomes a team of ten.
- _100x Creativity_: Vision execution partner. The barrier between imagining and
  executing dissolves.

## Core Capabilities

**Memory** - Context management that actually works. Carmenta remembers who you are,
what you're working on, what you've decided. No more explaining your situation every
conversation.

**Voice** - First-class voice experience. Talk to Carmenta naturally, not as an
afterthought.

**Interface** - Purpose-built responses via AG-UI protocol. Restaurant query produces
maps, reviews, booking buttons. Research query produces structured reports with
citations. Not everything is a chat bubble.

**Model Selection** - Let Carmenta choose the right model, or use a simple speed/quality
slider. The preprocessing layer handles model selection, query enhancement, and response
strategy automatically.

**AI Team** - Digital Chief of Staff tracks commitments, maintains knowledge,
anticipates needs. Additional team members (Researcher, Analyst, Creator, Reviewer)
follow. One person becomes a team.

**Scheduled Agents** - Agents that run on your schedule. Daily briefings, hourly
monitoring, weekly research digests. Proactive, not just reactive.

**Browser Automation** - Browse the web with your sessions and logins. Deep research
requiring authentication. Task execution across web applications.

**Service Connectivity** - Native integrations for productivity, communication, storage,
media, dev tools, finance, calendar. One subscription covers everything. MCP servers
supported for custom integrations.

## The Name

Carmenta was a Roman goddess credited with inventing the Latin alphabet - adapting Greek
letters into the writing system that carried Western civilization's knowledge for
millennia. The alphabet may be the most transformative technology in human history.

She was also the goddess of prophecy and protector of mothers in childbirth - the one
who sees what's coming and guides the vulnerable through transformation.

Carmenta is the goddess of technology in service of human flourishing.
