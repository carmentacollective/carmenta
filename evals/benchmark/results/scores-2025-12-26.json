      "response": "**Goodhart's Law** captures a fundamental problem in measurement and incentives: when we optimize for a metric rather than the underlying goal, people find ways to game the system. The measure becomes distorted because behavior shifts toward maximizing the number rather than improving what the number was meant to represent.\n\nThe mechanism is straightforward—once a metric carries consequences (rewards, rankings, funding), it creates pressure to improve that specific number. This pressure finds the gaps between what we're measuring and what we actually care about, then exploits them.\n\n## Education: Standardized Test Scores\n\nSchools judged by test scores face intense pressure to raise them. The predictable response: teach to the test. Narrow curriculum to tested subjects. Drill test-taking strategies. In extreme cases, exclude struggling students from test days, or administrators alter answer sheets.\n\nThe original intent—measuring student learning and school effectiveness—erodes. High scores no longer signal broad educational quality; they signal test preparation. Meanwhile, critical thinking, creativity, social skills, and subject depth outside the test disappear from focus. The metric improved while education quality stagnated or declined.\n\n## Healthcare: Hospital Readmission Rates\n\nThe Affordable Care Act penalized hospitals with high 30-day readmission rates, aiming to improve care quality and discharge planning. The measure assumed readmissions indicated inadequate treatment.\n\nHospitals responded by becoming more selective about admissions, sometimes classifying returning patients as \"observation\" rather than \"admission\" to avoid penalties. Some discouraged high-risk patients from seeking care at their facility. Others focused resources on the 30-day window while neglecting longer-term outcomes.\n\nThe readmission rate improved on paper, but the underlying goal—better patient care—became secondary to managing the metric. The measure stopped reflecting care quality and started reflecting gaming behavior.\n\n## Software Engineering: Lines of Code\n\nWhen programmer productivity gets measured by lines of code written, the dysfunction is immediate. Developers write verbose, repetitive code instead of elegant, concise solutions. Code becomes harder to maintain, bug-prone, and bloated—but the metric rises.\n\nSimilarly, counting bugs fixed incentivizes creating or reporting trivial bugs. Measuring deployment frequency without considering quality leads to empty commits. Sprint velocity as a target inflates story point estimates rather than improving actual throughput.\n\nEach metric was originally a reasonable signal—code output, bug resolution, shipping cadence, team capacity. Each became counterproductive the moment it determined performance reviews or bonuses.\n\n---\n\nThe pattern repeats across domains: **distance between measurement and goal creates exploitable space**. The tighter the coupling between what we measure and what we genuinely value, the more robust the metric. But perfect coupling is rare, which is why Goodhart's Law remains so persistently relevant.",
